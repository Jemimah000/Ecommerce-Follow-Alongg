Core Concepts Covered
--
**1.Overview of the MERN Stack:**

A JavaScript-only tech stack that simplifies development across frontend and backend.

Ideal for beginners üê£ because it uses one programming language (JavaScript) for everything.

**2.REST API Structure and Endpoints**:

Learn to create REST APIs to enable communication between the frontend and backend.

API functionalities include:

User Authentication: Securely register and log in users.

Product Management: Handle product creation, updates, and retrieval.

Order Handling: Manage customer orders and provide structured responses in JSON format.

**3.Basics of Database Schema Design:**

Define the structure of data in MongoDB (e.g., users, products, orders) for efficient storage and querying.

**4.Role of Authentication in Web Applications:**

Understand the importance of verifying user identity to secure sensitive operations like purchases and account management.
